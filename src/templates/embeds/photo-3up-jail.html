  <p class="cutline">Denton sisters (from left) Ciarra Booker, Ja’bria Rowland, Cenecia Booker, Sha’kylia Booker, Jessicah Rowland and Cenecia Booker walk to the gate to visit their mother Melisha Booker at the TDCJ Christina Melton Crain Unit in Gatesville, Texas, Saturday, April 8, 2017. Malishia Booker is serving twenty years for aggravated assault against a public servant. Booker is serving her time at the Christina Melton Crain Unit in Gatesville, Texas. She speaks during an interview with The Dallas Morning News on Tuesday March 14, 2017. For the Booker sisters, whenever their mother Malishia Booker went to jail, it seemed as though they were also being punished. Throughout their lives, they endured foster care, bouncing between relatives and toughing it out on their own. Critics say children of jailed women often get lost in a criminal justice system that doesn't count or track them. (Photos by Tom Fox and Andy Jacobsohn/Staff Photographer)</p>
