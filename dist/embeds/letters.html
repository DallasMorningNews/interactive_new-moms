        <h4>LeslieAnn Griffin</h4>
        <p>The 12-year-old girl came home from school one day in Garland and her mom was just gone.  </p>
        <p>Leslieann Griffin was in jail. Her daughter had no idea that months before, her mother had pleaded guilty to criminal charges for stealing from her employer.</p>
        <p>Griffin had stopped making restitution payments for nearly $50,000 worth of clothing, Coach purses and jewelry she’d illegally charged to a company credit card while working for a transportation firm in Grand Prairie. She had violated her probation and was now being held without bond.</p>
        <p>Neither police nor child welfare workers checked on her daughter while she was in jail, according to Griffin.</p>
        <p>“If I had been living alone, I’d have had no way to contact her,” Griffin says. “She could have been alone for days.”</p>
        <p>In fact, Griffin’s boyfriend was living in her home and broke the news to her daughter, who lived with him for at least a week. The child’s father (who lived in a different city) had learned what happened and came to get her. He did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
        <p>During the boyfriend’s one visit to the jail, he told Griffin what happened to her daughter — and then broke up with her.</p>

        <h4>Holly Martin</h4>
        <p>Holly Martin told us that she feared her children had been living on the streets since her arrest in Grayson County in 2015.  </p>
        <p>It was partly true, and finding them took months.</p>
        <p><em>The News</em> located Emiley Thompson, her oldest daughter, through court records and Facebook. Emiley’s friends call her “Lil’ Bit.”</p>
        <p>We traded messages for months, and talked briefly on the phone. She texted: “My lifes not been easy by far and the majority of that is because of fake twisted poor excuse people with a badge.”</p>
        <p>Emiley is an adult now, and had a handful of people she was able to crash with while her mom was initially jailed, she told us. She eventually went to stay with her dad in a town north of Dallas, near the Oklahoma border.</p>
        <p>For her brother and sister, both under 18, it’s been even harder. Their father died recently and they had no one else. Her brother got in trouble with the law and went to a juvenile detention boot camp for a while.</p>
        <p>Everything has been tough since their mother went to prison for drugs in 2011. After her first incarceration, she struggled to find a safe place to live with her kids, Martin says. They ended up living with people involved in the drug trade; she was charged with child endangerment in Grayson County and sent back to jail.</p>
        <p>The system doesn’t do enough to help women avoid falling back into addiction and criminal activity after completing prison, Martin says.</p>
        <p>What would help families like hers? “Figure out ways to help people get clean before it gets to the point of no return,” she wrote.</p>

        <h4>Yuryana Cornjeo Tapia-Juarez</h4>
        <p>Three-year-old Elijah Blu Cornjeo was playing in a park in Oak Cliff when the police arrived. They were there to arrest Mommy.  </p>
        <p>Before taking Yuryana Cornjeo Tapia-Juarez to the Dallas County Jail on drug charges in February 2016, police allowed her to call her sister, asking her to pick up Elijah. Which she did — and then promptly turned him over to Child Protective Services.</p>
        <p>What would happen to Elijah now? </p>
        <p>The day after his mother’s arrest, social workers drove him to a nice home on a cul-de-sac to live with Abby and Matt, a couple who said in an interview that they view foster care as their Christian mission. They spoke to <em>The News</em> on the condition we not use their last name.</p>
        <p> He was scared when he arrived, and cried out for Mommy. They told him that the Apostle Paul was once in prison, like his mom. “Is Mommy with Paul?” Elijah asked. In the backyard, he pretended to be arrested, clutching a Nerf ball behind his back as if he were wearing handcuffs.</p>
        <p>Just because people make mistakes doesn’t mean they’re bad people, his foster parents told him. They tracked his mother down at her court-ordered drug treatment program and paid for phone calls between mother and son.</p>
        <p>A year after Yuryana’s arrest, everyone suddenly wanted Elijah.</p>
        <p>His foster parents. An old boyfriend who said he was the father (a DNA test proved him wrong, court records show). Yuryana’s aunt and uncle in Florida, Carmen and Isidro Soto.</p>
        <p>Isidro installs flooring and paints houses; Carmen takes care of their sons, 12 and 17. They passed background checks and home visits, and traveled to Dallas several times for supervised visits and court hearings, according to court testimony.</p>
        <p>Both the Sotos and the foster parents initially said Yuryana could remain part of Elijah’s life. She had trouble making up her mind who should get him.</p>
        <p>Matt and Abby went to court seeking permanent custody that would end her parental rights. When the case went to trial this month, they paced the hallway outside the courtroom. Inside, Carmen sat with her hands folded in prayer. Yuryana never arrived —- jail officials blamed a paperwork error — so the pressed blue shirt and black dress pants Carmen brought for her lay slumped on a court bench.</p>
        <p>The two sides were supposed to argue about Elijah’s best interest. But the foster parents’ lawyer failed to file a key document; the judge dismissed them from the case. Matt and Abby left the courthouse in tears and filed an appeal.</p>
        <p>Carmen and Isidro were now Elijah’s guardians.</p>
        <p>This meant another fast goodbye for Elijah, this time to his foster family. He sobbed as a social worker picked him up in a black Nissan, took him out for chocolate-chip ice cream, then dropped him off with Carmen and Isidro.</p>
        <p>The Sotos left for Florida immediately. They wanted to take Elijah to the beach so he could wiggle his toes in the sand.</p>

        <h4>Marlene Gonzales</h4>
        <p>When a stranger left a 5-year-old girl in her driveway in Lubbock, the homeowner promptly called 911. Police and child welfare workers arrived to investigate the case of little Catalina Maree. </p>
        <p>Hours later, officers found the child’s mother, 31-year-old Marlene Gonzales, disoriented and begging for gas money at a Lubbock convenience store, according to a police report. She was holding her newborn son, Isaiah. He, too, went into protective care.</p>
        <p>Gonzales was arrested on an old drunken-driving charge and transferred to the Potter County Jail. She wasn’t eligible for bail. In a journal, she drew hearts near the names of her children: “Love you guys always. My days seem endless here. Under this bunk I lay here, hoping I haven’t been forgotten.”</p>
        <p>But where were her other four children? Her parents and siblings, who live in Amarillo, scrambled to find out.</p>
        <p>Their task was made harder when she died in jail last October. Officials reported her cause of death as hyponatremia, dangerously low sodium levels after she allegedly drank too much water. The Gonzales family is dubious.</p>
        <p>It took months — and help from a lawyer and a detective — for them to find their daughter’s kids. Two were in the custody of child welfare officials in New Mexico, where she had an abusive boyfriend. Two others, it turned out, had been taken in by the families of their fathers.</p>
        <p>Because her parents have their own criminal records, they were unable to get custody of any of the children. The last time they saw Catalina Maree was when a child welfare worker brought her to Marlene Gonzales’ funeral, to say goodbye.</p>
